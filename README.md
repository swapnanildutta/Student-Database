# Student-Database
The following project is a menu driven database system which can store student records and perform frequently used manipulation commands.
Basic CRUD functionality is programmed into main.java file, and the student.java file houses the definition of the student class, which is used to create instances of student records in the database.
This project was made by me for submission in the final assessment of Class 10th (ICSE).

## About JAVA
Java is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used to develop desktop and mobile applications, big data processing, embedded systems, and so on. According to Oracle, the company that owns Java, Java runs on 3 billion devices worldwide, which makes Java one of the most popular programming languages.

## Workflow
The main.java file initially prints a menu with 8 different options to perform the mentioned operations/queries on the database.
This is followed by a switch case code, which handles the input by the user and executes the appropriate block of code.
You must be familiar with OOPs concepts and basic JAVA programming in order to be able to work on this repository.
